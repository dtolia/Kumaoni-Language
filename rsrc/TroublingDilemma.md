# Why Kumaoni isn't Standardized?
The general perception around why Kumaoni isn’t standardized yet is as follows:

* Lack of Political Will;
* Dialect versus Language Debate;
* Inferiority Complex; and,
* Less effective presence in Popular Culture.

But an often ignored, troubling aspect is the various geographically-differentiated rules that the dialects of Kumaoni follows. Yes, the variations among कारक and सर्वनाम words may be attributed to synonyms which would make the language vocabulary stronger. But it is the different rules around verb tenses that make the standardization process complicated.

For example, the sentence “मैं एक सेब खा रहा था।” may be written in the various Kumaoni dialects as follows:
Dialect | Translation | | Dialect | Translation | | Dialect | Translation
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
रौ–चौबैसी | मैं एक स्यौ खनारछ्यू। | | फल्दाकोटिया | में एक स्यौ खाणों छी। | | कुमय्या | मे एक स्यौ खान्नै छ्यू।
खसपर्जिया | मे एक स्यौ खानै छ्यू। | | पछाइ | उत्तरी — मैं यौक स्यौ खामै छ्यू<br>दक्षिणी — मैं एक स्यो खां लाग रे छी। | | चौगर्खिया | मैं एक स्यो खनार छि।
सोर्याली | म इक स्यौ खाँ बरै थ्यू। | | अस्कोटी | म यूटो स्यौ खांदै थ्यु। | | सिराली | म इक स्यौ खानमरै छिउ।
गंगोली | मु यौक स्यौ खाँरछ्यु। | | दानपुरिया | मी एक स्यो खाड़ै हिउ। | | जोहारी | मे येक स्यो खान्ही।

Now suppose that some features of कुमय्या Kumaoni are not kept in Standard Kumaoni. That being so, the linguists would have to give a satisfactory reason to the कुमय्या people for this act. Otherwise they will not accept the standard dialect.

Hence, it becomes mandatory to publish some universally accepted principles following which the standard dialect may be composed.

## The Case of Almora City Dialect
Almora city was the capital of Kumaon during the late medieval era. Thus, people from various regions migrated there for better prospects and administrative work.

It is a generally accepted that Almora city dialect is खसपर्जिया, but that isn't true. Almora city lies in the Baramandal province and the dialect of this entire region is labelled खसपर्जिया. But since Almora city was settled by people from all across Kumaon and country, the city dialect drew influence from Sanskrit, Kannauji, and Awadhi alongside the various Kumaoni dialects. Thus becoming an ideal candidate for Standardized Kumaoni.

But post-2000, with the formation of the hill state of Uttarakhand, people started migrating to the भाभर cities of Ramnagar, Haldwani, and Tanakpur. Almora city dialect didn’t hold prominence here. Hence, people reverted to their regional dialects. Kumaoni became a language that people only used with family members. Eventually, some families stopped teaching the language to their children out of fear that it may negatively affect their Hindi/English accent and hinder professional growth.

And therefore, a promising dialect lost relevance among its people.

## A Possible Solution
I think of two theories in this context.

### First
Standard dialect construction should be done keeping Almora City Dialect as base to bring Kumaoni to the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. On observing other scheduled languages and constitutional articles, we know that only those languages have been included in the schedule which:
* differ from other scheduled languages; and
* strengthen Hindi.

Perhaps along these lines, a satisfactory reason may be provided for modifying the Almora City dialect to create the standard language.

### Second
Like standard Bengali and Gujarati, the decision on standard dialect should be left to the affluent class of Kumaoni society. That is, the language that pleases the well-to-do and gets their patronage should be the standard.

Therefore the dialect whose music and lyrics attract the Kumaoni elites sitting in Delhi and Bombay, the dialect which may be easily learned by everyone, shall become the standard.
