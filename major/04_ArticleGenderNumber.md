# Chapter-4: Article, Gender and Number

## Article
The numeral ēk एक (one) is commonly employed as an indefinite article (a/an). As usual, the place of the definite article (the) is supplied by a demonstrative pronoun (i.e. this, that, these, those).

## Gender
There are two genders, masculine and feminine. These generally follow the Hindi and Rajasthani rules. The distinction of gender is not confined to sex as in Khas-Kura. A few words which are feminine in Hindi and Rajasthani are masculine in Kumaoni. So, à̃kho आँखो (eye) is masculine in myɑ̀rɑ̀ à̃khɑ̀-mɑ̄ म्यर-आँखामा (in my eye).

## Number
There are two numbers, singular and plural.

1. तद्भव nouns which in Hindi end in ɑ̄, in Kumaoni as in Rajasthani end in o. Thus, Hindi chēlɑ̄ चेला becomes Kumaoni chelo चेलो (a son).

2. These nouns form the nominative plural by changing the final o to ɑ̀. Thus,
   - bhin̥o भिणो (wall); plural bhin̥ɑ̀ भिणा (walls).
   - bur̥o बुड़ो (Hindi: बूढ़ा); plural bur̥ɑ̀ बुड़ा (Hindi: बूढ़े).
   - chyŏlo च्यॉलो (son); plural chyɑ̀lɑ̀ च्याला (sons).

3. Feminine nouns in i (or ī) sometimes form the nominative plural in iyà̃ (or iyɑ̀) as in Hindi. Thus, cheli च्येलि (daughter) has nominative plural cheliyà̃ or cheliyɑ̀ च्येलियाँ (daughters), but this form is considered vulgar. The nominative plural of such nouns being regularly the same as the singular. 
   - Feminine nouns in i (or ī) sometimes also form the nominative plural by adding n at the end. Thus, cheli च्येलि (daughter) has nominative plural chelīn च्येलीन (daughters).

4.	In the case of other nouns, the nominative plural of such nouns being regularly the same as the singular. Thus, bɑ̀man बामन (Brahman or Brahmans); pau पौ (foot or feet).
