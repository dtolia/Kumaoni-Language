# Chapter-5: Case

As in other Indo-Aryan languages, cases are generally made by means of postpositions. Certain nouns are put into an oblique form before these are added.

## Rules of Oblique Form

1. In the case of most nouns, the oblique form singular is the same as the nominative. Thus,
   - ràjà-thē राजाथे (Hindi: राजा को); bàman̥-thē बामणथे (Hindi: ब्राह्मण को) 
   - ādimi-le आदिमिले (Hindi: आदमी ने)

2. But masculine तद्भव nouns in o make the oblique form singular (and also the nominative plural) by changing the o to à. Thus,
   - à̃kho आँखो (Hindi: आँख; nom. singular) becomes à̃khà आँखा (Hindi: आँखें; nom. plural and obl. singular). The oblique plural would be à̃khan आँखन (Hindi: आँखों).

3. Occasionally we come across an oblique form in ai, which is used for all kinds of nouns. It’s very commonly seen when using the genitive -ki case. Thus,
   - rājai-ki cheli राजैकि च्येलि (Hindi: राजा की बेटी).
   - The ai is even added to obl. plural form. Thus, obl. plural pāpin पापिन becomes pāpinai-ki durdàśà पापिनैकि दुर्दशा (Hindi: पापियों की दुर्दशा).
   - This termination ai must be distinguished from another termination āī which only gives emphasis, and does not indicate case. Thus, 
     - dvī द्वी (Hindi: दो) becomes dvīyāī द्वीयैइ (Hindi: दो ही).
     - swain̥ स्वैण (Hindi: सपना) becomes swain̥āī स्वैणैइ (Hindi: सपना ही).
     - inan jaso इनन जसो (Hindi: इन जैसा) becomes inanāī jaso इननैइ जसो (इन्ही जैसा).

4. Occasionally we also meet nouns whose nominatives do not end in o, yet they have an old oblique form in à. These forms are usually almost adverbs. Examples,
   - kār कार (Hindi: काल) becomes adharāt kārà-mā अधरात कारमा (Hindi: अर्धरात्रि काल में).
   - diś दिश (Hindi: दिशा) becomes uttar diśhà-thē उत्तर दिशथे (Hindi: उत्तर दिशा को).
   - kun̥ कुण (Hindi: कोना) becomes kun̥à-mā कुणमा (Hindi: कोने में).

5. Once or twice there are instances of an oblique form singular in n. Thus,
   - gàl̥ गळ (Hindi: गला) becomes gàl̥an-mā गळनमा (Hindi: गले में) and obl. plural becomes gàl̥anan-mā गळननमा (Hindi: गलों में).
   - tal̥au तळौ (Hindi: तालाब) becomes tal̥aun-mā तळौनमा (Hindi: तालाब में).

6. Otherwise, the oblique form plural is made by adding an or n to the nominative plural. If the nominative plural ends in à or à̃, this is changed to an. Thus,
   - kumār (a prince); nom. plural kumār; obl. plural kumāran.
   - chhyatri छ्यत्रि (a knight); nom. plural chhyatri; obl. plural chhyatrin छ्यत्रिन.
   - dagar̥i दगड़ि (a female companion); nom. plural dagar̥iyà दगड़िया; obl. plural dagar̥iyan दगड़ियन.

7. In one instance, the oblique plural ends in nà, instead of n. Namely,
   - kir̥o किड़ो (a worm); nom. plural kir̥à किड़ा; obl. plural kir̥anà किड़न.

8. When an oblique form ends in an unpronounced a, it takes that a again into pronunciation before the postposition le ले and ko को (kà का, ki कि). In the plural, this is optional before le. Thus,
   - bhar̥ भड़ (a warrior) has its agent case singular bhar̥a-le भड़ले (भड़ ने), and its genitive singular bhar̥a-ko भड़को (भड़ का).
   - In the plural, the agent is bhar̥an-le or bhar̥ana-le भड़नले (भड़ों ने), and its genitive is bhar̥ana-ko भड़नको (भड़ों का).

9. If an oblique case ends in à, then this à become a before these postpositions. Thus,
   - chelo चेलो (a son) has its agent case chyàla-le च्यलले (बेटे ने), and its genitive singular chyàla-ko च्यलको (बेटे का).

## Agent Case

1. The case of the Agent is employed exactly as in Hindi (and not as in Khas-Kurā), being used only with the subjects of transitive verbs in tenses formed from the past participle.

2. The verb agrees in gender and person with the object, when the object is in the form of the nominative.

3. If the object has the postposition thē थे (Hindi: को), then the verb remains in the masculine exactly as in Hindi.

4. In Kumaoni, this case is exactly the same in form as the instrumental; its postposition (as in Khas-Kurā) being le ले.

5. For example,
   - वी आदिमिले वीथे यो कयो। (wī ādimi-le wī-thē yo kayo)<br>
   [उस आदमी ने उसको यह कहा।]
   - राजाले मुनिकि बात मानि ली। (ràjā-le muni-ki bāt {fem.} màni-lī)<br>
   [राजा ने मुनि की बात मान ली।]
   - एक-एकले यो सारि बात कैन। (ēk-eka-le yo sàri bāt {fem. plural} kain)<br>
   [एक-एक ने ये सारी बातें कही।]
