# Chapter-2: Rules of Epenthesis

The change of a vowel owing to the influence of another vowel in the succeeding syllable is known as Epenthesis. Kumaoni has the following rules for epenthesis,

1. Rule-1: Whenever a long vowel is followed in the next syllable by a short vowel which is not the final silent “a”, that long vowel becomes short.
   - In such a case ɑ̄ is shortened to ɑ̀, ē to e, and ō to o. Hence, the Hindi sīr̥hī सीढ़ी will become sir̥hi सिढ़ि in Kumaoni.
   - The principal exceptions to this rule occur in the case of words borrowed from other languages like Arabic and Sanskrit.
   - Also a long vowel is not shortened before the infinitive termination n̥o णो, as in risɑ̄n̥o रिसाणो, to be angry.
   - There are also a few other exceptions in the conjugation of verbs, especially in the case of periphrastic tenses, which will appear in the tables of tenses.

2. Rule-2: When the letter “a” is followed by “ɑ̀”, it tends to become ɑ̀ itself.
   - Thus, the word ban̥ बण (forest) has its genitive ban̥a-ko बणको (वन का), which when agreeing with a masculine plural noun becomes ban̥ɑ̀-kɑ̀ बणक (वन के).
   - Example:
     - द्येखूँ हमि द्वीनमा को बड़ो छ!?! (dekhū̃ hami dwīn-mɑ̄ ko bar̥o chh)<br>
     [देखूँ हम दोनों में कौन बड़ा है!?!]
     - सारा बणक रुखनथे जो बड़ा-बड़ा छिया। (sɑ̀rɑ̀ banɑ̀-kɑ̀ rukhan-thē jo bɑ̀r̥ɑ̀-bɑ̀r̥ɑ̀ chhiyɑ̀)<br>
     [सारे वन के वृक्षों को जो बड़े-बड़े थे।]

3. Rule-3: When the letter “e” or “ē” is followed by “ɑ̀”, it becomes yɑ̀. 
   - Thus, mēro मेरो (Hindi: मेरा) has its masculine plural as myɑ̀rɑ̀ म्यर (Hindi: मेरे).
   - The Hindi word mēlɑ̄ मेला in Kumaoni becomes myɑ̀lɑ̀ म्यला.
   - Examples:
     - राजैकि च्येलि कालिंदी छूँ। (rɑ̀jai-ki cheli kɑ̄lindī chhū̃)<br>
     [राजा की बेटी कालिंदी हूँ।]
     - राजाक च्यलथे भलो आदिमि समजिबेर। (rɑ̀jɑ̀-kɑ̀ chyɑ̀lɑ̀-thē bhalo ɑ̄dimi samaji-bēr)<br>
     [राजा के बेटे को भला आदमी समझकर।]

4. Rule-4: The letter “o” or “ō” when followed by ‘ɑ̀’, becomes wɑ̀.
   - Thus, rot̥o रोटो (Hindi: रोटी) has its plural as rwɑ̀t̥ɑ̀ र्-वट (Hindi: रोटियाँ).
   - Examples: 
     - वीके र्-वट दिण जाँछु। (wī-kē rwɑ̀t̥ɑ̀ din̥ jā̃-chhu)<br>
     [उसको रोटियाँ देने जाता हूँ।]
     - थ्वड़ दिनन जाँलै। (thwɑ̀r̥ɑ̀ dinan jā̃lai)<br>
     [थोड़े दिनों तक।]

5. Rule-5: The letter “e” or “o” when followed by ‘o’, becomes yŏ and wŏ respectively. 
   - The ŏ in this case is pronounced like the ‘o’ in hot or policy.
   - Thus, mero मेरो (Hindi: मेरा) will become myŏro म्यॉरो. 
   - Similarly, rot̥o रोटो (Hindi: रोटी) will become rwŏt̥o र्-वॉटो.
   - But some people say that forms such as myŏro and rwŏt̥o are vulgar and not used in polite conversation.
   - Examples:
     - तसो च्यॉलो तेरो हैगो छ। (taso chyŏlo tero hai-go chh)<br>
     [ऐसा बेटा तेरा हो गया है।]
     - भारि पहाड़ जसो ब्वॉजो। (bhɑ̀ri pahɑ̄r̥ jaso bwŏjo)<br>
     [भारी पहाड़ जैसा बोजा।]
