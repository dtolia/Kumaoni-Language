# Chapter-18: Past Conditional

1. The Past Conditional tense is formed from the Present Participle, to which personal terminations are added directly. Thus, Present Participle hit̥ano हिटनो (Hindi: चलता), becomes Past Conditional hit̥anū̃ हिटनूँ (Hindi: यदि मैं चलता).

2. The third person singular adds no termination. The tense thus closely agrees with the corresponding tense in Hindi formed from the present participle without any suffixes at all (चलता).

3. The following is the paradigm of this tense. When the feminine is the same as the masculine, no form is given for the feminine.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (1) | hit̥anū̃ हिटनूँ ; hit̥anyū̃ हिटन्यूँ ; hit̥anī̃ हिटनीं | hit̥anū̃ हिटनूँ ; hit̥anā̃ हिटनाँ |
| (2) | Masc. - hit̥anai हिटनै; <br>Fem. - hit̥anī हिटनी | hit̥anā हिटना |
| (3) | Masc. - hitan̥o हिटनो; <br>Fem. - hit̥ani हिटनि | Masc. - hit̥ànà हिटनऺ; <br>Fem. - hit̥anin हिटनिन |

4. The forms for the irregular verbs are based on the corresponding present participles and require no further  explanation.

5. The following is an example of the use of this tense,
