# Chapter-21: Past

1. The Past tense is formed by taking the strong form of the verbal past participle, and adding personal suffixes.

2. In the third person singular and masculine plural, no suffix is added, and we have the past participle standing by itself. The following is the paradigm,

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (1) | hit̥yū̃ हिट्यूँ | hit̥ā̃ हिटाँ |
| (2) | Masc. - hit̥ai हिटै; <br>Fem. - hit̥ī हिटी | hit̥ā हिटा |
| (3) | Masc. - hit̥o हिटो; <br>Fem. - hit̥i हिटि | Masc. - hit̥à हिटऺ; <br>Fem. - hit̥in हिटिन |

3. The above is the conjugation of all regular verbs, both transitive and intransitive. But it must be remembered that in the case of transitive verbs the tense is treated passively, while hitū̃ (intransitive) means ‘I went,’ marū̃ (transitive) means ‘I was killed.’ ‘I killed him’ would be mī-le vī-kan̥i màro.

4. The construction is, in fact, exactly the same as in Hindi, the verb agreeing in gender and number with the object, when the latter is in the form of the nominative, and otherwise being in the third person masculine singular.

5. The irregular verbs base their conjugation on the irregular strong past participles, and the only form which presents any difficulties is the third person plural feminine, which is as follows,

| Infinitive | Third Person Plural Feminine |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| rūn̥o रूणो (Hindi: रहना) | rayin रयिन or rain रैन (Hindi: रहीं) |
| kūn̥o कूणो (Hindi: कहना) | kayin कयिन or kain कैन (Hindi: कहीं) |
| dekhūn̥o देखूणो (Hindi: दिखाना) | dekhayin देखयिन or dekhain देखैन (Hindi: दिखायीं) |
| . | . |
| ūn̥o ऊणो (Hindi: आना) | àyin आयिन or ain ऐन (Hindi: आईं) |
| lyūn̥o ल्यूणो (Hindi: लाना) | lyàyin ल्यायिन or lyain ल्यैन (Hindi: लाईं) |
| . | . |
| jān̥o जाणो (Hindi: जाना) | gayin गयिन or gain गैन (Hindi: गईं) |
| . | . |
| hun̥o हुणो (Hindi: होना) | bhayin भयिन or bhain भैन (Hindi: हुईं) |
| . | . |
| din̥o दिणो (Hindi: देना) | diyin दियिन or dīn दीन (Hindi: दीं) |
| lin̥o लिणो (Hindi: लेना) | liyin लियिन or līn लीन (Hindi: लीं) |

6. The following are examples of the use of the past tense of intransitive verbs,
   - मी मर्यूं। (mī maryū̃)<br>
   [मैं मरा / मरी।]
   - मी भलो है गयूँ। (mī bhalo hai gayū̃)<br>
   [मैं अच्छा हो गया / गई।]
