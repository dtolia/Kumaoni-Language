# Chapter-3: Miscellaneous Properties

1. An initial “e” is often pronounced “ye” and “ya” by the vulgar, and this sometimes appears in writing, so that we may find such a word as etuk (इतना) written as yetuk or yatuk, but this pronunciation is not heard in polite conversation.

2. When the letter “ɑ̄” is followed by “i”, the two together form the diphthong ‘ai’ (not ‘ɑ̄i’ as in Hindi).
   - Thus, the Hindi for ‘he came’ would be ɑ̄i-gayɑ̄ आइ-गया or ɑ̄-gayɑ̄ आ-गया. But in Kumaoni it is ai-gayo ऐ-गयो.
   - This change is extremely common. Thus we have,
     - laut̥ai diya लौटै दिया (Hindi: लौटा-इ दिया).
     - dekhai-bēr द्येखै-बेर (Hindi: दिखा-कर).
     - sun̥ain सुणैन (Hindi: सुनाना); root- sun̥ɑ̄ सुणा, cause to hear. 
     - sikai सिकै (Hindi: सिखाया); root- sikɑ̄ सिका, teach. 
     - jai-bēr जै-बेर (Hindi: जा-कर).
     - ai-bēr ऐ-बेर (Hindi: आ-कर).

3. Words in Hindi which have ‘ɑ̄u’ end up having ‘au’ in Kumaoni. Thus,
   - Hindi ghɑ̄u घाउ becomes ghau घौ (wound) in Kumaoni.
   - Hindi nɑ̄u नाउ becomes nau नौ (name) in Kumaoni.
   - And pɑ̄ũ-chhiyo पाउँ-छियो is written as paũ-chhiyo पौं-छियो (he was obtaining).

4. The letters ल (l) and ळ (l̥) when medial or final are often dropped, and to prevent the hiatus thus called, the letter व (w) is generally inserted in its place. Thus, 
   - बादल often written as बादव (cloud).
   - कालो often written as कावो (black).
   - थोल often written as थोव (lips).

5. There is a strong tendency to dis-aspirate. Consonants which are aspirated in Hindi are commonly dis-aspirated in Kumaoni. Thus,
   - Hindi पढ़ा becomes पड़ो (read) in Kumaoni.
   - Hindi बोझा becomes ब्वॉजो (a load) in Kumaoni.
   - Hindi सूख गया है becomes सुकि गे छ (has dried up) in Kumaoni.

6. The cerebral ण (n̥) is very common in Kumaoni.
   - In words which are not borrowed, but have reached the language from Sanskrit through the medium of Prakrit has remained a cerebral in Kumaoni. Thus,
     - Sanskrit वनः becomes वणो in Prakrit, and therefore is बण in Kumaoni.
   - But if the Prakrit word has ण्ण or न्न then we have न in Kumaoni. Thus,
     - Prakrit कण्णो becomes कान in Kumaoni.
   - On the other hand, in तत्सम words, borrowed directly from Sanskrit, we have न if the word in Sanskrit has न too. Thus,
     - Sanskrit दिनम्, धनम्, and मनः becomes दिन, धन, and मन in Kumaoni.
   - This rule only applies to a medial n. An initial n is never cerebral.

7. Kumaoni also has a cerebral ळ (l̥), which is subject to exactly the same rules as the cerebral ण (n̥). 
   - This is well illustrated by the following pairs of words,
     - Prakrit बलं becomes Kumaoni बळ (force), but Prakrit बोल्लै becomes Kumaoni बल (he says).
     - Prakrit काळो becomes Kumaoni काळो (black), but Prakrit कल्लो becomes Kumaoni कालो (deaf). 
   - It must be remembered that, as in the case of n, an initial l is never cerebral.

8. The semi-consonant व (v or w) is very often written उ (u), especially before इ (i) or ई (ī). Thus we have both वि (vi) and उइ (ui) for उस (him/her).

9. As in Khas-Kura, there is a preference in Kumaoni for short vowels at the end of a word. Thus the Hindi नामी becomes नामि (famous) in Kumaoni.

10. Nasalization by चन्द्र-बिन्दु (ँ) is very common, and is often omitted in writing.
