# Chapter-8: Auxiliary Verbs & Verb Substantive

In the general principles of its conjugation Kumaoni closely follows Hindi; but the participial tenses all take personal terminations, and there is an independent passive voice formed by adding ī ई to the root (as in Khas-Kura). The Auxiliary Verb form is used in association with other main verb. Verb Substantive form is used independently.
