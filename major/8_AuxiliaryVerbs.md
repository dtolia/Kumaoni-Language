# Chapter-8: Auxiliary Verbs & Verb Substantive

In the general principles of its conjugation Kumaoni closely follows Hindi; but the participial tenses all take personal terminations, and there is an independent passive voice formed by adding ī ई to the root (as in Khas-Kura). The Auxiliary Verb form is used in association with other main verb. Verb Substantive form is used independently.

## Present Tense

### Verb Substantive
| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (1) | chhū̃ छूँ (I am) | chhū̃ छूँ (we are) |
| (2) | chhai छै (masc.); chhē छे (fem.) {thou art} | chhau छौ (you are) |
| (3) | chh छ (he/she is) | chhan छन (they are) |

### Auxiliary Verb
| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (1) | chhũ छुँ | chhũ छुँ |
| (2) | Masc. - chhai छै; <br>Fem. - chhē छे (optional) | chhā छा |
| (3) | Masc. - chh छ; <br>Fem. - chhya छ्य / chhe छ्ये (optional) | chhan छन |

The form chh of the third person singular has in prose no vowel, and is pronounced together with the final syllable of the word which precedes it. Thus,
- bar̥o chh = bar̥ochh बड़ोछ.
- katuk chh = katukchh कतुक्छ.

In poetry, as usual, the final ‘a’ may be pronounced, so that we should have bar̥o chha, katuka chha. <b>Note</b> that in this document we have preferred the poetry style for prose writing as well.

### Perfective
The present perfect tense of the verb rū̃n̥ō रूँणो (Hindi: रहना) is very frequently employed as auxiliary. The perfect, I have remained, is used to mean ‘I am.’ As the conjugation of this verb is somewhat irregular, this tense is here given in full detail.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (1) | Masc. - rau-chhũ रौछुँ; <br>Fem. - rai-chhũ रैछुँ | Masc. - rau-chhũ रौछुँ; <br>Fem. - rai-chhũ रैछुँ |
| (2) | Masc. - rau-chhai रौछै; <br>Fem. - rai-chhai रैछै | Masc. - rau-chhā रौछा; <br>Fem. - rai-chhā रैछा |
| (3) | Masc. - rau-chh रौ छ; <br>Fem. - rai-chh रै छ | Masc. - rī री or raī रई; <br>Fem. - rī̃ रीं or raī̃ रईं |

In the above table, ra र may be substituted for rau, and rē रे for rai.

### Negative Verb Substantive
There is a negative verb substantive nihātū̃ निहातूँ or nhātū̃ न्हातूँ (I am not/I will not be) which is thus conjugated,

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (1) | Masc. - nihātū̃ निहातूँ; <br>Fem. - nihātyū̃ निहात्यूँ | Masc. - nihātū̃ निहातूँ; <br>Fem. - nihàtiyū̃ निहतियूँ |
| (2) | Masc. - nihàtai निहतै; <br>Fem. - nihātyē निहात्ये | Masc. - nihàtau निहतौ / nihātā निहाता; <br>Fem. - nihàtiyau निहतियौ / nihàtiyā निहतिया |
| (3) | Masc. - nihàti निहति; <br>Fem. - nihàte निहते | Masc. - nihàtan निहतन; <br>Fem. - nihàtan निहतन / naĩ नैं |

Similarly, we have the negatives rau-nihàti रौनिहति, he is not, and rau-nihàtan रौनिहतन, they are not, etc.
