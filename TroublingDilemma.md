# Why Kumaoni isn't Standardized?
The general perception around why Kumaoni isn’t standardized yet is as follows:

* Lack of Political Will
* Dialect versus Language Debate
* Inferiority Complex
* Negligible presence in Popular Culture

But an often ignored, troubling aspect is the various geographically-differentiated rules that the dialects of Kumaoni follow. Yes, the variations among कारक and सर्वनाम words may be attributed to synonyms which would make the language vocabulary stronger. But it is the different rules around verb tenses that make the standardization process complicated.

For example, the sentence “मैं एक सेब खा रहा था।” may be written in the various Kumaoni dialects as follows:
Dialect | Translation | | Dialect | Translation | | Dialect | Translation
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
रौ–चौबैसी | मैं एक स्यौ खनारछ्यू। | | फल्दाकोटिया | में एक स्यौ खाणों छी। | | कुमय्या | मे एक स्यौ खान्नै छ्यू।
