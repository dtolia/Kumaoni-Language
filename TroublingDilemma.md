# Why Kumaoni isn't Standardized?
The general perception around why Kumaoni isn’t standardized yet is as follows:

* Lack of Political Will;
* Dialect versus Language Debate;
* Inferiority Complex; and,
* Less effective presence in Popular Culture.

But an often ignored, troubling aspect is the various geographically-differentiated rules that the dialects of Kumaoni follows. Yes, the variations among कारक and सर्वनाम words may be attributed to synonyms which would make the language vocabulary stronger. But it is the different rules around verb tenses that make the standardization process complicated.

For example, the sentence “मैं एक सेब खा रहा था।” may be written in the various Kumaoni dialects as follows:
Dialect | Translation | | Dialect | Translation | | Dialect | Translation
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
रौ–चौबैसी | मैं एक स्यौ खनारछ्यू। | | फल्दाकोटिया | में एक स्यौ खाणों छी। | | कुमय्या | मे एक स्यौ खान्नै छ्यू।
खसपर्जिया | मे एक स्यौ खानै छ्यू। | | पछाइ | उत्तरी — मैं यौक स्यौ खामै छ्यू<br>दक्षिणी — मैं एक स्यो खां लाग रे छी। | | चौगर्खिया | मैं एक स्यो खनार छि।
सोर्याली | म इक स्यौ खाँ बरै थ्यू। | | अस्कोटी | म यूटो स्यौ खांदै थ्यु। | | सिराली | म इक स्यौ खानमरै छिउ।
गंगोली | मु यौक स्यौ खाँरछ्यु। | | दानपुरिया | मी एक स्यो खाड़ै हिउ। | | जोहारी | मे येक स्यो खान्ही।

Now suppose that some features of कुमय्या Kumaoni are not kept in Standard Kumaoni. That being so, the linguists would have to give a satisfactory reason to the कुमय्या people for this act. Otherwise they will not accept the standard dialect.

Hence, it becomes mandatory to publish some universally accepted principles following which the standard dialect may be composed.

## The Case for खसपर्जिया
Almora city was the capital of Kumaon during the medieval era. Thus, people from various regions migrated there for better prospects and administrative work. This made the Kumaoni dialect of Almora city (खसपर्जिया) popular in the Kingdom. But post-2000, with the formation of the hill state of Uttarakhand, people started migrating to the भाभर cities of Ramnagar, Haldwani, and Tanakpur. खसपर्जिया dialect didn’t hold prominence here. Hence, people reverted to their regional dialects. Kumaoni became a language that people only used with family members. Eventually, some families stopped teaching the language to their children out of fear that it may negatively affect their Hindi/English accent and hinder professional growth.

These are some of the prime reasons why खसपर्जिया couldn’t be used as the standard dialect for Kumaoni.
